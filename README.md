You must have .net 4.5 installed to play.

Instructions:
=============

You can only play the white side.
Click on a checker to start a move.
The square you clicked on will be displayed in the bottom left corner in algebraic notation.
If it seems like you can't move then you probably must jump and you're just not seeing it.

Click the "New Game" button to start over at any time.
The green square next to the "New Game" button means it's your turn.

Good luck...
